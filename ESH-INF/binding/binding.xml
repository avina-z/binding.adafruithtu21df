    <description>This is the binding for adafruit HTU21D-F Sensor
                 This I2C digital humidity sensor is an accurate and intelligent Humidity and Temperature Sensor.
                 It has a typical accuracy of ±2% with an operating range that's optimized from 5% to 95% RH. 
                 Operation outside this range is still possible - just the accuracy might drop a bit. 
                 The temperature output has an accuracy of ±1°C from -30~90°C.
